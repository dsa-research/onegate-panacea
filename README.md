# PANACEA OneGate 

The OneGate service allows Virtual Machines guests to push monitoring information to OpenNebula. Users and administrators can use it to gather metrics, detect problems in their applications, and trigger OneFlow auto-scaling rules

This project as part of the [PANACEA Project](http://projects.laas.fr/panacea-cloud/node/11) extends the OneGate functionality so that Virtual Machines guests can retrieve information of itself and the service it belongs to, and send actions to OpenNebula to reconfigure the service.
